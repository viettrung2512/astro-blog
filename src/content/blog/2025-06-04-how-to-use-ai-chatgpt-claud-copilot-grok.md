Lerasium was created by Leras.[\[21]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lerasium#cite_note-Arcanum-6046-21) [Rashek](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rashek "Rashek") collected the beads,[\[22]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lerasium#cite_note-Arcanum-140-22) after taking the power of Preservation at the [Well of Ascension](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Well_of_Ascension "Well of Ascension"), and used them to entice foreign kings to become his allies.[\[23]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lerasium#cite_note-Arcanum-8001-23) He left two beads near the Well, for reasons unknown.[\[24]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lerasium#cite_note-MSH-2-1-24)

However, neither of these beads were used prior to the fall of the Final Empire. One bead was fed to [Elend](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Elend "Elend") to save his life after being attacked by Leras, whose hand was directed by [Kelsier](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kelsier "Kelsier"), in an attempt to prevent Vin from releasing Ruin from the Well.[\[25]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lerasium#cite_note-The_Well_of_Ascension-58-chapter-25)[\[26]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lerasium#cite_note-The_Well_of_Ascension-59-chapter-26)[\[27]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lerasium#cite_note-MSH-2-4-27) The other was stolen and consumed by [Hoid](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hoid "Hoid"), after he used the Well to transition from the Cognitive Realm to the Physical.[\[28]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lerasium#cite_note-Arcanum-12210-28)[\[24]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lerasium#cite_note-MSH-2-1-24)

[Wax](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Waxillium_Ladrian "Waxillium Ladrian") was later able to split ettmetal using [trellium](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Trellium "Trellium") to create more lerasium, which was later used by Wax and [Wayne](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Wayne "Wayne"), creating the first known Mistborn since the [Lord Mistborn](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Spook "Spook") right after the [Catacendre](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Catacendre "Catacendre").[\[7]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lerasium#cite_note-The_Lost_Metal-71-chapter-7) [Kelsier](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kelsier "Kelsier") wishes to use it to create an army of Mistborn to fight against the armies of [Autonomy](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Autonomy "Autonomy"), though Harmony rejects these plans.[\[29]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lerasium#cite_note-The_Lost_Metal-epilogue-4-29)
